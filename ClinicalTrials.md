### Get Started

This task view provides an overview of R packages relevant to the design, monitoring, and analysis of clinical trial data. 

Packages are grouped in the following categories:

- [**Design**](#design): tools to support a variety of clinical trial designs. The packages are further categorized into subgroups, such as [*adaptive designs*](#adaptive-designs), [*bioequivalence study designs*](#bioequivalence), [*dose-finding designs*](#dose-finding), [*factorial designs*](#factorial-designs), [*group sequential designs*](#group-sequential-designs), [*randomization*](#randomization), [*response adaptive randomization*](#response-adaptive-randomization), [*sample size and power calculations*](#sample-size-and-power-calculations), and [*simulation*](#simulation) for clinical trial designs.

- [**Monitoring**](#monitoring): tools dedicated to monitoring of clinical trials, such as computing the probability of crossing sequential boundaries along its interim analyses, sample size re-estimation, etc.

- [**Analysis**](#analysis): tools for implementing commonly used analysis method in clinical trials. The packages are further categorized into subgroups, such as [*general analysis*](#general-analysis), [*longitudinal data analysis*](#longitudinal-data-analysis), [*survival analysis*](#survival-analysis), [*meta-analysis*](#meta-analysis), [*missing data imputation*](#missing-data-imputation), as well as [*analysis for specific designs*](#other-analysis-for-specific-designs).

Here are several foundational books on clinical trial design and analysis that can help users gain a deeper understanding of the methods implemented in the relevant R packages: 

- *Clinical Trials: A Practical Approach* by Pocock (2013) `r doi("10.1002/9781118793916")`.

- *Fundamentals of Clinical Trials* by Friedman et al. (2015) `r doi("10.1007/978-3-319-18539-2")`.

- *Sample Sizes for Clinical Trials* by Julious (2023) `r doi("10.1201/9780429503658")`.

- *Group Sequential and Confirmatory Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials* by Wassmer and Brannath (2016) `r doi("10.1007/978-3-319-32562-0")`.

- *Bayesian Adaptive Methods for Clinical Trials* by Berry et al. (2010) `r doi("10.1201/EBK1439825488")`.

In 2021, the R Foundation for Statistical Computing published the guidance document [*Regulatory Compliance and Validation Issues (A Guidance Document for the Use of R in Regulated Clinical Trial Environments)*](https://www.R-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf), which outlines its consensus on the use of R in GxP-regulated environments. This document provides a structured framework to help end users align with internal procedures, fulfill documentation requirements, and comply with regulatory standards.


### Inclusion Criteria

The packages included in this task view were carefully curated through a combination of expert recommendations from the pharmaceutical industry and academia, as well as an automated CRAN search using the `pkgsearch::pkg_search()` function. The search leveraged keywords aligned with our grouping categories, such as *clinical trials, study design, adaptive design, sample size calculation*, etc. Packages were considered within scope if they offered tools to facilitate the design, monitoring, or analysis of clinical trials. 

Some task views may include packages that are also relevant to clinical trials and will be listed within the grouping categories. Please refer to task views `r view("ExperimentalDesign")`, `r view("Meta-analysis")`, `r view("MissingData")`, `r view("Pharmacokinetics")`, `r view("Survival")` for a more comprehensive list of R packages related to these topics.  Note that while the `r view("Pharmacokinetics")` task view packages are closely related to clinical trials, they are not explicitly listed under the grouping categories in this task view to avoid duplication.

The TEQR (toxicity equivalence range) design is a toxicity based cumulative cohort design with added safety rules; the ACT (Activity constrained for toxicity) design is also a cumulative cohort design with additional safety rules with the unique feature of this design is that dose is escalated based on lack of activity rather than on lack of toxicity and is de-escalated only if an unacceptable level of toxicity is experienced.
    
- `r pkg("BOIN")` The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It can be used to design both single-agent and drug-combination trials. The BOIN design yields an average performance that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.
